fbkeyboard
This is a framebuffer softkeyboard for use on devices with touchscreen input like smartphones.
It was designed for the linux text console.
It uses lib freetype to render fonts.
Keystrokes will be send to the kernel using uinput

How to build:
just run make in this directory

How to run:
./fbkeyboard [-d inputdevice] [-f font]
inputdevice has to be the device node of the touchscreen, eg: /dev/input/event1.
If no inputdevice was given, the first device in /dev/input with absolute axes support will be used.
font has to be a ttf file. If no font was given, "/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf" will be used.

usefull tips:
use stty to adjust the console size to avoid overlapping the console and the kayboard.
stty rows <number-of-rows>
